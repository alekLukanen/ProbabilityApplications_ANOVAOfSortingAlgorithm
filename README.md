# AVOVA Project for Selection Sort
Using the same implementation of Selection Sort attempt
to find a difference in runtimes for different size arrays
and different sorted data.

Example of expirement:
|           | Size 1 | size 2 | size 3 | 
|---        |---     |---     |---     |
|ordering 1 |    v    |    v    |    v    |
|ordering 2 |    v    |    v    |    v    |
|ordering 3 |    v    |    v    |    v    |

## Build the Development Environment
To create your python environment simply run
```
make build_env
```
from this repositories base directory and then run
```
source env/bin/activate
```
as well. This will activate the virtual environment 
created in the first line of code. All development should
be done using this environment to ensure that results can
be reproduced by other contributors.
